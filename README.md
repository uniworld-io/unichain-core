## Build application
### Prepare dependencies

* JDK 1.8 (JDK 1.9+ are not supported yet)
* On Linux Ubuntu system (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS), ensure that the machine has [__Oracle JDK 8__](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-get-on-ubuntu-16-04), instead of having __Open JDK 8__ in the system. If you are building the source code by using __Open JDK 8__, you may get fails

### Build application from source code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uniworld-io/unichain-core.git
# checkout to stable version 
cd unichain-core
./gradlew build 
```
Binary files located in `build/libs` folder. 

### Run application
```bash 
cd build/libs
java -jar unichain-core.jar
     _   _ _ __ (_) ___| |__   __ _(_)_ __  
    | | | | '_ \| |/ __| '_ \ / _` | | '_ \ 
    | |_| | | | | | (__| | | | (_| | | | | |
     \__,_|_| |_|_|\___|_| |_|\__,_|_|_| |_|

```
Run unichain node with customized config
```bash
cd build/libs
java -jar unichain-core.jar -c ./your_localtion/of_config_file.conf
```
If you are witness, run unichain node with *--witness* and *-p* options (-p: witness private key)
```
java -jar unichain-core --witness -p your_witness_private_key
java -jar unichain-core --witness -p d06f6fbea126162c1bfac04869cf94331ca2a98610737e4b05b56527b0b8bf45
