# How to Build

## Prepare dependencies

* JDK 1.8 (JDK 1.9+ are not supported yet)
* On Linux Ubuntu system (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS), ensure that the machine has [__Oracle JDK 8__](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-get-on-ubuntu-16-04), instead of having __Open JDK 8__ in the system. If you are building the source code by using __Open JDK 8__, you will get [__Build Failed__](https://github.com/uniworld-io/unichain-core/issues/337) result.
* Open **UDP** ports for connection to the network
* **Minimum** 2 CPU Cores

## Build and Deploy automatically using scripts

- Please take a look at the [Unx Deployment Scripts](https://github.com/uniworld-io/UnxDeployment) repository.

## Getting the code with git

* Use Git from the console, see the [Setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) articles.
* `develop` branch: the newest code 
* `master` branch: more stable than develop.
In the shell command, type:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/uniworld-io/unichain-core.git
  git checkout -t origin/master
  ```

* For Mac, you can also install **[GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/)** then **[fork and clone our repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)**. 

* If you'd rather not use Git, **[Download the ZIP](https://github.com/uniworld-io/unichain-core/archive/develop.zip)**

## Including unichain-core as dependency

If you don't want to checkout the code and build the project, you can include it directly as a dependency.

**Using gradle:**

```
repositories {
   maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
dependencies {
   implementation 'com.github.uniworld-io:unichain-core:develop-SNAPSHOT'
}
```
  
**Using maven:**

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>    
      <id>jitpack.io</id>
      <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.uniworld-io</groupId>
    <artifactId>unichain-core</artifactId>
    <version>develop-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <!--You can use any of the tag/branch name available-->
</dependency>
```

## Building from source code

- **Building using the console:**

  ```bash
  cd unichain-core
  ./gradlew build
  ```

- **Building using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (community version is enough):**

  **Please run `./gradlew build` once to build the protocol files**

  1. Start IntelliJ.  
  Select `File` -> `Open`, then locate to the unichain-core folder which you have git cloned to your local drive. Then click `Open` button on the right bottom.
  2. Check on `Use auto-import` on the `Import Project from Gradle` dialog. Select JDK 1.8 in the `Gradle JVM` option. Then click `OK`.
  3. IntelliJ will import the project and start gradle syncing, which will take several minutes, depending on your network connection and your IntelliJ configuration
  4. Enable Annotations, `Preferences` -> Search `annotations` -> check `Enable Annotation Processing`.
  5. When the syncing finishes, select `Gradle` -> `Tasks` -> `build`, and then double click `build` option.
