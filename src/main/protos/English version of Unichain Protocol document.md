# Protobuf protocol

## The protocol of UNICHAIN is defined by Google Protobuf and contains a range of layers, from account, block to transfer.

+ There are 3 types of account—basic account, asset release account and contract account, and attributes included in each account are name, types, address, balance and related asset.
+ A basic account is able to apply to be a validation node, which has serval parameters, including extra attributes, public key, URL, voting statistics, history performance, etc.

     There are three different `Account types`: `Normal`, `AssetIssue`, `Contract`.

      enum AccountType {   
         Normal = 0;   
         AssetIssue = 1;   
         Contract = 2;
        }

     An `Account` contains 7 parameters:  
     `account_name`: the name for this account – e.g. “_BillsAccount_”.  
     `type`: what type of this account is – e.g. _0_ stands for type `Normal`.  
     `balance`: balance of this account – e.g. _4213312_.  
     `votes`: received votes on this account – e.g. _{(“0x1b7w…9xj3”,323), (“0x8djq…j12m”,88),…,(“0x82nd…mx6i”,10001)}_.  
     `asset`: other assets expect UNW in this account – e.g. _{<“WishToken”,66666>,<”Dogie”,233>}_.
     `latest_operation_time`: the latest operation time of this account.
     
      // Account 
      message Account {   
        message Vote {     
           bytes vote_address = 1;     
           int64 vote_count = 2;   }   
        bytes accout_name = 1;   
        AccountType type = 2;   
        bytes address = 3;   
        int64 balance = 4;   
        repeated Vote votes = 5;   
        map<string, int64> asset = 6;
        int64 latest_operation_time = 10; 
       }
       
     A `Witness` contains 8 parameters:  
      `address`: the address of this witness – e.g. “_0xu82h…7237_”.  
     `voteCount`: number of received votes on this witness – e.g. _234234_.  
     `pubKey`: the public key for this witness – e.g. “_0xu82h…7237_”.  
     `url`: the url for this witness – e.g. “_https://www.noonetrust.com_”.  
     `totalProduced`: the number of blocks this witness produced – e.g. _2434_.  
     `totalMissed`: the number of blocks this witness missed – e.g. _7_.  
     `latestBlockNum`: the latest height of block – e.g. _4522_.
     `isjobs`: a bool flag.
     
      // Witness 
      message Witness{   
        bytes address = 1;   
        int64 voteCount = 2;   
        bytes pubKey = 3;   
        string url = 4;   
        int64 totalProduced = 5;   
        int64 totalMissed = 6;   
        int64 latestBlockNum = 7; 
        bool isJobs = 9;
       }

+	A block typically contains transaction data and a blockheader, which is a list of basic block information, including timestamp, signature, parent hash, root of Merkle tree and so on.

     A block contains `transactions` and a `block_header`.  
     `transactions`: transaction data of this block.   
     `block_header`: one part of a block.
      
         // block

           BlockHeader block_header = 2; 
          }

     A `BlockHeader` contains `raw_data` and `witness_signature`.  
     `raw_data`: a `raw` message.  
     `witness_signature`: signature for this block header from witness node.

     `parentHash`: the hash of last block – e.g. “_7dacsa…3ed_.”  
     `number`: the height of this block – e.g. _13534657_.  
     `witness_id`: the id of witness which packed this block – e.g. “_0xu82h…7237_”.  
     `witness_address`: the adresss of the witness packed this block – e.g. “_0xu82h…7237_”.

         message BlockHeader {   
           message raw {

          raw raw_data = 1;   
          bytes witness_signature = 2; 
          }

     message `ChainInventory` contains `BlockId` and `remain_num`.  
     `BlockId`: the identification of block.

     A `BlockId` contains 2 parameters:

     `number`: the hash and height of block.
     
         message ChainInventory {

               bytes hash = 1;
               int64 number = 2;
             }
             repeated BlockId ids = 1;
